# Handwritten Character Recognition

## Project Overview

This project is developed as part of the CodeAlpha Machine Learning Internship.

The objective of this project is to recognize handwritten digits using Image Processing and Deep Learning techniques. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Dataset Loading

The MNIST dataset is loaded using TensorFlow.

### 2. Image Preprocessing

* Normalize pixel values.
* Reshape images for CNN input.

### 3. CNN Model

The model consists of:

* Convolution Layer
* Max Pooling Layer
